# Thiru – Portfolio v1

This is my first personal portfolio website built using **HTML only**.

## 📌 About This Project

The main goal of this portfolio is to build a strong foundation in **HTML structure, semantic tags, and forms** before moving to CSS and JavaScript.

- Semantic HTML  

## 📂 Sections Included
- Header with name and role  
- About Me section

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice clean and semantic HTML  
- Understand real-world website structure  
- Prepare for future upgrades using CSS, JavaScript, and MERN stack  

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add CSS for styling and responsiveness  
- Add JavaScript for interactivity
